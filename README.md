Just an example of Custom Popup Window. We do only the following two things in this simple example-
<ul>
<li> Create a custom pop up window with its own layout and setup basic UI to code linkages.</li>
<li> Communicate between the custom popup and an activity's fragment via an interface. </li>
</ul>
